  /**important distinction between the PeerServer and a Peer instance
   * 
This runs once on your machine (or on a server in production).

Its job is signaling: it helps peers find each other and exchange WebRTC offers/answers/ICE candidates.

You do not create a PeerServer for every user. Itâ€™s a single centralized process that all peers connect to.
